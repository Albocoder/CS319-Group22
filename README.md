Description:
<p> "Be Someone Else!" is a text based multiplayer role playing game that will be developed in Java. The user will enter a chat lobby anonymously and will choose a character from three random options. With a randomly given timeline, place and an occuring event, he will have to improve the story with the other users who act like their character. 

Additional features and design plan will be added soon.
