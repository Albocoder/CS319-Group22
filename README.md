### Description:
<p> "Be Someone Else!" is a text based multiplayer role playing game that will be developed in Java. The user will enter a chat lobby anonymously and will choose any free character left for the scenario they chose to play at. With a predesigned timeline, place, event and character (added by the game admins), he will have to improve the story with the other users who act like their character. 
</p>
<p>
Then the player will have their chat saved in our databases and he/she can later share it. The more the player plays the more they can earn points. In different events users can participate with the plots they have played before for that particular event's scenario and be voted by the readers as "Best Actor", "Best Villain", "Best Supportive Character" etc. The more they earn achievements the more they climb the "Hall of Fame" board.
