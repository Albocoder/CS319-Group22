### Description:
<p> "Your Story!" is a text based multiplayer role playing game that will be developed in Java. The user will enter a chat lobby anonymously and will choose any free character left for the scenario they chose to play at. With a predesigned timeline, place, event and character (added by the game admins), he will have to improve the story with the other users who act like their character. 
</p>
<p>
Then the player will have their chat saved in our databases and he/she can later share it. The more the player plays the more they can earn points. The user can then review his play by reading what was saved.
