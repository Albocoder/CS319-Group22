The lobby has exactly 3 states it can be in. The first state right after the initialization it the waiting state where the lobby is supposed to wait until the player quota is filled up or until the current participants decide to cast a vote in order to start the game. At this state the users inside the lobby can use the chatbox to get to know each other or even make any decision before the game starts. If the voting is successful or if the quota is fulfilled the game will start. The first thing that the game will do is delete all the chat messages so that the story can start. When it starts then the users can exit the lobby and connect to it at any time to give his contribution. The third step is when the players vote to end the game and it was successful. In this state the lobby will save all the chat in the server and will return back to home page to let the user join a new game.
